# The Picobat project #

## Overview ##

Picobat is a free (as in freedom) and cross platform batch interpreter
intended as an alternative to CMD, the native windows interpretor for
batch files.

It is designed around 3 key-ideas :

* **Portability**, with the ability of being run on a variety of platforms
from Windows to almost any Unix-based operating system (Linux, Bsd...)
and architecture from pc to arm-based. With a few tricks, you can even
get Picobat to run on an android smartphone.

* **Speed**, Picobat reaches incredibly high execution speed on Unix-based systems.
It also provides an internal multi-threading system that allows it to overtake
CMD on execution speed on windows.

* **Lightness** and **flexibility**, Picobat is designed to be lightweight and be used
in many different ways, from the regular set-up to the embedded installation on an
USB stick for example. 

## Features ##

After almost 10 years of intermittent development, Picobat now features
a really wide range of functionalities from basic general batch programming to
Picobat specific extensions. Among them :

* Full support of **environment variables** with extensions to support floating
point arithmetic.

* Improved support of **IF** command with extensions that enable more complex
expressions to be specified.

* Support of all **FOR** command flavours, allowing to specify more complex
script-based input.

* Enhanced support of jumps via **GOTO** and **CALL**, with the ability to
specify both file name and label at a time.

* Brand-new, really aesthetic **HELP** command to provide the most complete
information about batch programing.

* A lot of commands and extensions associated with them that make
batch programming an even more exciting programing language !

Sounds Great, isn't it ? Why not give Picobat a try ? Installation details
and instruction can be found [here](/download).
