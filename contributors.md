## Authors and contributors ##

The Dos9 project has been started quite a while ago (nearly 10 years
from now) while I was studying at high school, mostly as a hobby project,
I was not really intending to do something serious. As years passed by,
this interpreter got bigger and bigger, leading to the almost
cmd-compatible interpreter that it is now.

- Romain Garbi : The initial author and core developer of Dos9.
	He started the project and is still leading the
	development.
- Teddy Astie : Developed some code and debugged many parts of Dos9.
	He is the second developer of the project.
- Xenoxis : Lots of helps submitting bugs. Designed manual pages styles.
