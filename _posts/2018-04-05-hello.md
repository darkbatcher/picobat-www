I am proud to announce the opening of the new Dos9 development blog.
I used to have a development blog previously but I could not find 
enough time to maintain it so finally ended up offline ages ago.
Hopefully this second instance of the blog will last longer than
its predecessor.

This blog will discuss topics about batch programming in general,
some more topic more specific to Dos9, and obviously development
new in general.

As you can see, the site design has really changed (I am now using picocms)
but there is still some stuff to setup to get the site functional.
Anyway, I hope you will have great time here, and enjoy the new blog and 
design.
