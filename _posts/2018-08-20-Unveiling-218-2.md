Hello everyone ! Today, I announce that a new version of Dos9 is now available,
providing a bunch of really interesting improvements. Check it out now and
download it at the [download page](/download).

## New features ##

We have been implementing some new features as well in addition to fixes to
bugs.

### Precedence changes ###

The precedence of commands (and especially [FOR](/doc/for) and [IF](/doc/if)
commands) has been changed. As of version **218.1**, operators like `|`, `&`
and their derivatives owned precedence over any type of command. For instance
`IF %var%==test echo var & echo test` would have been interpreted like 
`(IF %var%==test echo var) & echo test`. This behaviour was problematic as it
broke the traditional syntax.

Version **218.2** fixes this introducing the concept of *lookahead* commands,
that swallow everything on the right end side of the command. Thus, the
previous line is now equivalent to:

```
IF %var%==test (echo var & echo test)
```

Currently, the only *lookahead* commands are **IF** and **FOR**.

As a consequence of these modifications, [Dos9](/doc/dos9) now supports an odd
syntax using [stream redirections](/doc/spec/red), that is, any redirection
encountered within **IF** or **FOR** part of the command line applies to the
first command following (e.g. `IF > foo 1==1 echo test & echo foo` is
equivalent to `IF 1==1 (echo test > foo) & echo foo`). 

### Autocompletion ###

![autocomplete]({{ "/assets/autocomplete.png" | absolute_url }}){: .center-image }

One of the features that has been the most requested was proper support of
keyboard input for both Linux version and utf-8 version for windows. Those
features have been implemented through **linenoise** and **libcu8**.

Among other improvements, **Dos9** now provides a proper autocompletion
method for both Linux and Windows (only for utf-8 version). Instead of cloning
the odd autocompletion method used by cmd, **Dos9** supports a bash-like
autocompletion.

When `<TAB>` is pressed, **Dos9** extracts the last token and searches for
files matching:

* If there is no common match between the files matching, **Dos9** prints a
  list of files that matches the last token.

* If there is a common match, **Dos9** completes the line with the longest
  common match.

### New commands ###

As usual, the **218.2** version brings also a couple of news commands with
it:

* [SETLOCAL](/doc/setlocal) and [ENDLOCAL](/doc/endlocal) : creating new
  local environment and resuming old environment is now supported. 
* [prompt](/doc/prompt) : A cmd-compatible `PROMPT` and `%PROMPT%`
  implementation with a bunch of additions.
* [pecho](/doc/pecho) : A command to print formats for the `PROMPT` command
  without affecting the actual `%PROMPT%`.
* [timeout](/doc/timeout) : A cmd-compatible `TIMEOUT` with the possibility
  to sleep for milliseconds. 

### Experimental UNC support ###

The new windows version also include an experimental support of UNC paths
without using a virtual drive letter. The `CD` command still does not supports
it though.

## Minor fixes ##

To end with, there is a few minor fixes also available:

* Lots of minor fixes concerning locales and internationalization. Localization
  works perfectly using Windows. Dates are know formatted using the locale
  preferred format. A new locale for Hindi has been added thanks to
  Karanveer Chouhan.
* Fixes to utf-8 version, especially to the interactive command-lines user
  routines.
* Fixed a long standing bug with colours under Unix-like operating systems,
  that where shuffled compared to Windows.
* [Dos9_Auto.bat](/doc/dos9_auto), the script loaded at startup, has been
  modified to contain default `%PROMPT%` value and the startup screen, so
  that both of these parameters are more easily customizable.
